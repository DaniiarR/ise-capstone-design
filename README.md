# Remote Home Gas Leakage Inspection Robot for ISE Capstone Design Course at Inha University

## Overview

This project aims to develop a remote home inspection robot capable of autonomously navigating through a home environment, inspecting for gas leakages, and providing real-time feedback to the user. The robot utilizes ROS (Robot Operating System) for its software architecture.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** User-friendly remote control interface accessible via a computer or mobile device.
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Autonomous mapping of the environment to aid navigation.
- **Navigation:** Path planning and obstacle avoidance for safe and efficient movement.
- **Automated Patrol:** Ability to autonomously patrol a designated area or follow a predefined route.
- **Object Recognition:** Identification of common objects relevant to home inspections.


## Hardware and Software Requirements

- **Robot Base:** TurtleBot3
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04
- **ROS Version:** ROS 2 Foxy


## Dependencies

- ROS 2: [Install ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/).
- Additional ROS packages for TurtleBot3, sensors, cameras, and navigation as per your hardware setup.
